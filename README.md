# uSaleOnline
Created in 2013, "uSale" is a service that allows students to buy and sell used goods, such as textbooks, in a controlled environment. To increase transaction security, each user is required to use a ".edu" email address from a supported university in order to register an account. During a transaction, each party is emailed the supplied personal information (provided when registering for the site at the user's discretion) of the other to streamline the communication process. The website also included a search feature and categorized lists to allow a faster traversal of available goods. On a user's personal account page, they can easily keep track of purchased goods, sold goods, and pending transactions.  Created in collaboration with Alex Haff and Devin Visslailli. Supported up to version 1.5
